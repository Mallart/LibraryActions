# LibraryActions
## What is it ?
It's a program that handles books and libraries management through structs in Ada.

## What's its purpose ?
Our school asked us to program an application that runs in terminal and that can handle book management in a library in Ada.
It just shows how to manipulate structs equivalent (records) in Ada to simulate a storage from which we can remove, search or add content.

## What did we learn ?
Doing this project, we learnt to collaborate on a Ada project and to manipulate records, arrays, and user input.
